# LICENSE ME

The GUI-Adaption from my Rust-CLI-Program [License-Me](https://github.com/frequency403/license-me)

## The Initial Idea

As this is my first Program with a Graphical Interface,  
this program's purpose was to teach me, how to design and use  
different kinds of control elements in windows gui.

The initial requirement for the program, was to offer the user  
an easy-to-use GUI for licensing his projects.

## Getting Started

Download the Ready-to-Run Executable from the Releases


### Installing

Is not needed, the program is a Standalone-Application.  
The Program needs to run as Administrator!

### Settings

The Program will generate a "settings.json" file in its Execution-directory  
There will the settings be saved

The Setting-Values are:
- GitHub Username (needed for API-Communication)
- GitHub Token (optional, adding mor API-Request possibilities)
- License-Link (A link to a Plain License-File in the Internet, that will be used as Template)
- ReplaceInReadme (The Phrase i.e.```# PROJECT NAME``` that will be replaced with the repo-name)
